# QA Applicants Test Plugin - QA Documentation

Welcome! This repository contains the QA test documentation for the QA Applicants Test WordPress plugin.

## Where to Find the Tests

All test cases, results, and QA documentation are provided in the following Markdown files:

- **QA_Test_Checklist.md**: A quick checklist and guide for manual testing. It includes all test cases, expected results, and a summary of issues found during testing.
- **QA_Test_Report.md**: A detailed test report with test results, environment details, screenshots, and recommendations. This file documents the full QA process and findings.

## How to Review

1. **Start with `QA_Test_Checklist.md`** to see the test plan, test cases, and a summary of pass/fail results.
2. **Read `QA_Test_Report.md`** for a comprehensive breakdown of the testing process, detailed results, screenshots, and recommendations for improvements.

No automated tests are included; all QA was performed manually and is documented in the above files.
